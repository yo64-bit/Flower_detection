## Flower_detection
This is the project that we created on samvid Hackathon(Bhilai).It is useful for the horticulture farmer.It uses machine learning to detect the flowers by taking its photo and all the information about that flower with its specific disease and its remedies provided by us and further farmers can call helpline number(Krishak Helpline) given in  the app for assistance.
We also provided nearby shop location where one can buy pesticides and seeds(remedies) for the flower and besides this we also included all the information about sarkari yojnas(goverment schemes) for farmers
